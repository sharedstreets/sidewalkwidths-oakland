# Sidewalk Widths Oakland

Sidewalk Widths Oakland shows a map of approximate sidewalk widths in the city, as well as the location of current Slow Streets program areas, and additional streets under consideration.

Sidewalk lines and width information collected as part of the [City of Oakland](https://www.oaklandca.gov/)'s most recent sidewalk inventory in 2006. This data was provided, upon request, by the city. In this dataset, centerline width is given as one measurement value per sidewalk line, which generally corresponds to one blockface. The data is dated and has some accuracy limitations, given that sidewalk width varies along a block face due to bulb outs and other variations. However, it represents best-available city data and can be used for an overall impression of sidewalk width across the city.

Slow Streets data is available on the [City of Oakland website](https://www.oaklandca.gov/projects/oakland-slow-streets) and is changing with some regularity. It was accessed on April 21, 2020, and accurately reflects implemented Slow Streets at the time this site was published (April 27, 2020).

This map is inspired by, and forked from, Meli Harvey's [Sidewalk Widths NYC](http://www.sidewalkwidths.nyc) project. However, the methodology is different since Oakland's width data was collected by the city and was not derived from polygon data.
